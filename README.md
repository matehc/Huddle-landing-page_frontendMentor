## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the media query on various break-points.

```css
@media () {}
```


### Continued development

Areas I would like to continually focus on in future are: 

Thought Process: All projects requires planning and a good thought process. I think i need to work on this aspect in future in order for me achieve a better result in my future projects.

-Bem Methodology: I understand the importance of using the BEM methodology and as such would like to improve on how i name my classes for better styling and reusability.

-Responsiveness of my web projects: I still have a lot to learn in this regard. I have started employing the use of relative units and media queries. Though I find difficulty in accommodating all screen sizes but I believe it is a gradual process and I will hone the skill soon.

-Accessibility: I need to start implementing accessibility practices in my projects

### Useful resources

- [Design course html css crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXLjWRteuWI&t=837s) - This helped me in implementing the hero background image to cover its viewport. I really liked this hack and will use it going forward.
- [Introduction To Responsive Web Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&t=2978s) - This is an amazing tutorial on Responsive Web Design. It helped me in my approach to making this project responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
