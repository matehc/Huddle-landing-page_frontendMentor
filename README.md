## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the media query on various break-points.

```css
@media () {}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Areas I would like to continually focus on in future are: 

Thought Process: All projects requires planning and a good thought process. I think i need to work on this aspect in future in order for me achieve a better result in my future projects.

-Bem Methodology: I understand the importance of using the BEM methodology and as such would like to improve on how i name my classes for better styling and reusability.

-Responsiveness of my web projects: I still have a lot to learn in this regard. I have started employing the use of relative units and media queries. Though I find difficulty in accommodating all screen sizes but I believe it is a gradual process and I will hone the skill soon.

-Accessibility: I need to start implementing accessibility practices in my projects

### Useful resources

- [Design course html css crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXLjWRteuWI&t=837s) - This helped me in implementing the hero background image to cover its viewport. I really liked this hack and will use it going forward.
- [Introduction To Responsive Web Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&t=2978s) - This is an amazing tutorial on Responsive Web Design. It helped me in my approach to making this project responsive. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
